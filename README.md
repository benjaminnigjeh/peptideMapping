# peptideMapping data pipeline
This is a data pipeline repo to generate fasta files and open format mzML files, that are followed by spectra matching. 

# generating fasta files 
Fasta files are generated based on two distinct modules, namely, to generate each individula fasta file (fastaGen), and then to combine fasta files (fastaConcat).
